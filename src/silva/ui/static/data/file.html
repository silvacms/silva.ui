<p>
  Silva is a powerful CMS for organizations that manage multiple or complex websites. Content is stored in clean and
  futureproof XML, independent of layout and presentation. Features include versioning, workflow system, integral
  visual editor, content reuse, sophisticated access control, multi-site management, extensive import/export facilities,
  fine-grained templating, and hi-res image storage and manipulation. Silva has an open source (BSD) license.

<p>
  Silva supports a separation between authors who create new content and editors who decide whether content actually
  gets published. It also allows delegation of editing the responsibilities for a section of a site to others. This
  avoids a single-person bottleneck without the loss of editorial control.

<p>
  To assist in the publication process, Silva implements workflow where multiple versions of the same document are
  stored. A document may be published while a newer version can be edited simultaneously. Silvaâ€™s workflow supports
  email notification to streamline the production process.
